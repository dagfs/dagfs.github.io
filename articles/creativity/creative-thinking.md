# Creative thinking (for developers)

Over the years I've been introduced to Edvard De Bonos 6 thinking hats on half a dozen ocations. 
I have been trough trough more workshops than I can count on two hands and one foot. 
Each of the workshops has had multiple warmup exercises and a series of steps to helps us ideate. 
These exercises and steps has not always seemed to make sense and I've hard to embrase them as
I haven't understood them.

Yet I have always had much fun exploring my own ideas and think of myself as creative. Despite this 
I regularly meet roadblocks that seems to hinder my creativity when I need it the most. Being demotivated, 
tired, or stressed is some of the situations that seem to be a big hinderance to generating new ideas and solutions.

To better understand my own creativity and creativity at work, I have read and tought a lot about the topic.
In this article I aim to share what I have learned to help you embrase you creativity, learn to use a series of tools to 
be creative, and learn a bit about how to collaborate creativly. 


## Define creativity

Just to make sure we are on the same page, I want to try to explain what I mean 
when I think og creativity.

Oxford Languages defined creativity as:
> the use of imagination or original ideas to create something; inventiveness.
>
>-- <cite>Oxford Languages</cite>

What is an original idea is a hot potato of a topic as so much of what we humans do is a 
remix of ideas. This is highlighted by *Kirby Ferguson* in his documentary [Everything is a Remix](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/).

To dig deeper in this defenition. Ideas are toughts, and thougts [TODO finn er fornuftig kilde] and thoughts are the results of different external and internal stimulus. 

Putting these two togheter one can argue creativity is generating ideas based on what you know combined with some external stimulus, such as a problem to solve. One thing to add, is that we seldom go for the first idea that pops into our head. We need to do a few iterations.

There is a somewhat know quote about creativity by Dilbert creator *Scott Adams*
> Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep.
>
> -- <cite>Scott Adams</cite>

Failing is overused and popuralized by Silicon Valley [todo kilde - Adam savage?]. 
What we often mean when we say failing, is simply iterating. It often takes a few tries to get things right. That does not mean you fail for each iterations. The goal of the first few iterations is simply to learn.

> Creativity is solving a problem trough an iterative process where both the problem and the solutions can evolve. Art is knowing when to stop iterating and what to keep. 


## Embrase you creativity


## creativity  tools

snakk videre om hvordan vi resonerer og kommer frem til løsninger. Hvordan det å bruke ord hjelper, hvordan det å lage flere ideer hjelper


## creative at work
snakk om hvordan det som produseres på workshops ofte er external input til designere i den kreative prosessen da de lærer masse og tar med det de lærer + det de kan for å lage nye løsninger.
