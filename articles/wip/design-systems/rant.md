# Design systems

We are no longer thinking of design systems.

Design systems has become storybook.
This is a shame as the word design is broad enough that it could be used for what we have in mind.

What we are thinking of is a holistic process that helps the team collaborate easier. It helps guide how and what desitions are made and who to involve. It lets the team document their desitions in a meaningful way that is easily accessible to the team. It makes it easy to find back to previously takeled problems and use the same approach, the same desitions, to solve new problems.

What we think of when we say design systems is a team that collaborate well, that uses each others strengths and shares what they have done as to help the team work more united.
Design systems can help solve important problems, but they are an investment that costs to maintain. And if the team does not use it, its value is lost. If team members creates duplicates of existing components, the value of a designsystem is degraded. If the other team members does not point out that the member created a duplicate, then the designsystem seems rather pointless.

There are also the problems of syncing the designers sketches with what is documenter in the component library in the design system. But that is a problem to discuss at another time.

The point is that when we think of design systems, we think of this holistic process that makes the team work closer, more united, guided by the same desitions. This simplifies a lot of work, and removes a lot of problems we face today. Duplicated components or styling placed in odd places that no-one but the one who made it knows about. It makes it easier to do our job as we can fall back on previous desitions so that we can focus on what has not been solved yet instead of solving it over and over.

But why should we change the way we work? It is nice to be so independent. Just do what you do. Not checking for similar solutions. Adding your own style to the project. Well... collectively we have decided that individualism in a project is bad by enforcing code formatter that fixes tabs, curly bracket placement and end of line characters. So we have already agreed that unifying, working together in a uniform way, is what is best for the team and the project. We have just not figured out how to do it well in other aspects.

I'm sure that by this point some of you strongly disagree that your team does not work in a unified way. That you have guidelines for how things should be done. And that the whole team, or at least one person enforces this when reviewing pull requests?

Well it seems like you are part of the minority. At least if you have managed to have this discipline across the board in regards to team members, and problems you solve.
Even if you have these rules. Are they written in a way that allowes your philosophies to be followed when that one person, or the whole team is exchanged?

Our point is that we think it is important for teams to take conscious desitions for what they do and document it in a way that lets the team enforce their own policies. If not, then the project quickly fills up with individualistic unconscious choices(, or unintentional design as we like to think of it), that may guide futher desitions by simply existing, solidifying the quick and dirty solution one developer intended to change before merging what they was working on, but then being interrupted by something, forgetting to correct the code and merging it.
It is time to look at what we could call our methodology, or prosess. Design system is taken. It now means storybook.

Design is such a nice word. We apply it in all fields to describe something that was done by intention. Intentional choices. Systems is likewise a fitting word, as it is the word we use for organising things, of splitting a bigger thing into smaller organised parts with relation to each other.

Systems design is likewise taken.

We could add words in front of design systems. Like unified, universal. But the distinction would be small and partly redundant. It would also end up creating more confusion than good.
Intentional design. Feels equally redundant. As it is the norm that design is intentional, and the exception, when it is not.

I can feel now that my connection to the higher consciousness is broken and the I will have to resume ideating names for our philosophy, our process, at a later point.

Todo:
- go trough a few more words that can explain what we are trying to share is
- rant about it is not about technologies, not about frameworks
- it is not a certain technology that makes things responsive - this point is a bit on the side, but it is a uestion i've gotten by someone who has not worked with web before.
- the problem with software : why smart engineers write bad code
- utvikling-utenfor-skissene is an atempt to collect best practices for a lot of development
