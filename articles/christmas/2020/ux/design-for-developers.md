  - get attention https://www.canva.com/learn/multi-page-layout/

people does not read text. https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/26/designing-for-people-who-have-better-things-to-do-with-their-lives/ would be fun with an interactive thing where you can try for yourself and see if you read the text before you interact then get penitalized for doing wrong in some way. "try it" opens modal. With long text instructing you to click the button for three second. You just press it and nothing happends. or you get taunted. Then there is a button that indicates how you shouldinteract with it instead of the long text.

the mouse is hard to use. https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/27/designing-for-people-who-have-better-things-to-do-with-their-lives-part-two/ try it opens a lot of modals in different places that are hard to click. then it opens so that it is in the same place over and over. then it can open so the most common action is at your button.

users dont remember things https://www.joelonsoftware.com/category/uibook/ chapter 8. show users a list of animals and their name. in the next slide the user should write the name of the lion. if it gets wrong show them the list again. then ask for another animal. then show them both at the same time to show how it could be better. then maybe see if you can make it so they dont have to enter anything.
