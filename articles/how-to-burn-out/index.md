# How to burn out and prevent your self from recovering

This is my take at a three-quarters-mortem hoping three quarters trough my burnout.

*_NB_* For optimal effect introduce a pandemic to ensure your idle anexiety level and stress is abnormally high.

## Setup
Get increasingly anxeouse as you try to navigate the world from an early age, elimentary school if at all possible. This is the stage where you transition from 
the safe circle of family and friends that were often currated by your parents. You have to start to get to know and adjust to other environments like your class, the playground and extra corricular activities(is that kinda like football?). This is the time many learns to use alchohol, food, sex or drugs to manage stress[look up resource]

Being anxeouse and trying as much as you can to adopt to everyone around you and not to affend anyone is a good way to steadely increase you 
anexity level. If you start feeling shame for when you fail to please everyone around you at all times you get to explore depression.

Continue this circle and do things that is driven by your anexity and not in your control in front of a few adults who interpret your behaviour as bad and calls you out 
on what you really can not control. This makes sure you feel like everything you do are wrong and makes you afraid to try anything without guidance from someone. 
It also makes it hard to trust as you expect to be judged at all times and try to police yourself.

The result might be high functioning anxiety and a supression of feelings.

Spend the next dozen years controlled by anexiety but pushing trough faster than you are able to absorb your experiences while numbing your self to avoid feeling your feelings. Have a releationship or a few to gain reactive patterns to common releationship challenges. Start working and look for ways to complete the dream of a place to live, a partner, a good careere, kids and a car. If you get all that in place you get to be happy right. No one can say that you are not successfull.

Determining that your hobbies and ways of dealing with stress is unproductive or unhealty and working to reduce them or eliminate them from your life without reducing your stress or finding new ways to releave your stress futher increases your anexiety level and wears you down.

Using Baxter the horse from animal farm as a role model and working harder instead of smarter ansures that you have multiple close calls where you push yourself so far as to get sick or having to cancel plans to just recover.

How is it possibly to get this far you might think? "Surly you must see what you are doing to yourself?". If only it had been the case. Continuing avoiding your feelings and numbing yourself prevents you from interspection and ensures you stay reactive. To break free of this state there has to be an insident that forces you to change ways and hopefully gain a higher conciounce.

## Handeling stress
What happends when you experience more stress than you can handle is in Norway and they look at you and tell you to take 2 weeks of and see if you manage to build some overskudd and to see if your mind just restores itself. 

## Why you need hobbies
You need some activities you do for fund and for mastery. You do them and are happy with your result and you do not judge it as it is not meant to be perfect. It is just something you do to relax and restore.

You need multiple hobbies as things can prevent you from doing one of your hobbies. Im taking the all out aproach to heling you building a safety net. You might lose your arm. If your hobby is not easely adjustable to this change in your life you suddely lose your way of releaving stress and that is not good. Our goal is recielience, having multiple hobbies and trying to figure out what you enjoy about that particular hobbie will make you more recilient as you can adjust.

For me Ive looked at pole dancing that is one activity ive been doing regularly for 3 years. Due to the lockdown I was prevented from doing this activity and I lost that way of managing stress. Deconstructing the activity Ive come to understand that I really enjoy dancing, movement to music also works well and I have enjoyed group classes with music as well. I also enjoy the feeling of being upside down and spinning. Things that helps me be in my body. Poledance is also painfull so its in the regard an excelent way of grounding you. You are litterally supporting your whole body weight from small areas of your skinn that connects with the pole.
