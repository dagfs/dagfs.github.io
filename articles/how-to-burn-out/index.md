# How to burn out and prevent your self from recovering

This is my take at a three-quarters-mortem hoping three quarters trough my burnout.

*_NB_* For optimal effect introduce a pandemic to ensure your idle anexiety level and stress is abnormally high.

## Setup
Get increasingly anxeouse as you try to navigate the world from an early age, elimentary school if at all possible. This is the stage where you transition from 
the safe circle of family and friends that were often currated by your parents. You have to start to get to know and adjust to other environments like your class, the playground 
and extra corricular activities(is that kinda like football?). 

Being anxeouse and trying as much as you can to adopt to everyone around you and not to affend anyone is a good way to steadely increase you 
anexity level. If you start feeling shame for when you fail to please everyone around you at all times you get to explore depression.

Continue this circle and do things that is driven by your anexity and not in your control in front of a few adults who interpret your behaviour as bad and calls you out 
on what you really can not control. This makes sure you feel like everything you do are wrong and makes you afraid to try anything without guidance from someone. 
It also makes it hard to trust as you expect to be judged at all times and try to police yourself.
