# Masters Writing at Three AM

What is it like writing a masters?
Well, currently I'm awake at 3am trying to finish the items I would like to have finished before a meeting with my supervisor at 10am. I have had 10 days to do it, but was first not able to get things done, then had a break as it was easter and I was hoping that would allow me to come back strong. It sort of has.

The reasons I am not asleep right now is because I could not get it done yesterday and ended up just burning all my energy procrastinating and worrying. That is after I made frog[1] cards where I wrote up the main thing I needed to get done. So instead of getting things done I feel asleep at 9pm from exhaustion and woke up now to stressed to fall back to sleep. This is like exam nerves and is probably related to why I'm feeling more tense in my back, shoulders and hips lately.

I did sort of get the frog done tough. The frog was my research question. It should have been done much earlier, but was not. There is multiple reasons for this. Changing what the goal of the masters, being stressed out when trying to create one because it is a hard task. Just doing things instead of getting one done. But it has to be done now as I will be running the first of three evaluations of my work next week and the research question is needed to know what and how to evaluate.

It feels like I'm doing this wrong, but can not see how to do it better. The same goes for my peers that I talk to about working on masters. It feels like I don't understand what I need to understand to do research as well as what I understand about doing research seems fragile and prone to err. Orwell's term "doublethinking" comes to mind.[2]

> Doublethink is the act of simultaneously accepting two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct, often in distinct social contexts.[1] Doublethink is related to, but differs from, hypocrisy and neutrality. Also related is cognitive dissonance, in which contradictory beliefs cause conflict in one's mind. Doublethink is notable due to a lack of cognitive dissonanceâ€”thus the person is completely unaware of any conflict or contradiction.

Accepting that rigorous research is the way to gain new knowledge while acknowledging that there is many psychological factors affecting the participants.

* The participants answer differently when the researcher is nearby
* The wording of the questions affects what the participants answer
* If the participant is asked to give an opinion they have not made up before their opinion might be affected by the wording of the question and the context resulting in not just a bad data point but also in a person opinions being manipulated, not intentional, but still manipulated.  

These are worst case scenarios. They can be worked against, but it is hard to mitigate all together. This is why I feel like I at this point have to apply doublethinking to be able to work efficiently. Knowing that rigorous research is they way, but seeing that it is fragile and not knowing enough to get rid of the feeling of a crumbling way. I do believe this is because of my limited understanding of doing research and hope that with better understanding it would not be necessary.

If you buy now are thinking, "boy, it sounds like you are in a pit of cognitive dissonance", I would say you are right. Mindfully applying doublethinking here till I'm done with this project feels like a fair action. You can not question everything and still get something done. Maybe ignorance is strength after all?
