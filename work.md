# Manual

https://9gag.com/gag/aGjn037

This document is a collection of articles related to developing a manual of oneself that can help improve your relationships by communicating clearly how best to communicate with you.

Just to be clear. This is not meant to be something where you can write "If you can not handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best". If you find this true, then I do not think you will get anything out of the rest of this document.

This document is meant to help you reflect on yourself as well as communicate how others can communicate to you better. We are all different, and we try not to hurt the people around us.

This projects comes out from the [The School of Life's video An Instruction Manual To Oneself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgGDwYYfayI). There are however multiple other projects that looks at this. In [Leaders need “User Manuals” – and what I learned by writing mine](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leaders-need-user-manuals-what-i-learned-writing-mine-abby-falik/) by Abby Falik shares her personal user manual and talks a bit about how it has worked for her and her team. More about this type of manual can be read in [Completing this 30-minute exercise makes teams less anxious and more productive](https://qz.com/1046131/writing-a-user-manual-at-work-makes-teams-less-anxious-and-more-productive/) and the back story of the approach can be read about in [A guide for the 'all about me' generation](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170318-writing-the-user-manual-for-yourself).

There are [several](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-deal-with-me-a-user-manual-for-all-my-friends-1747296558) [other](http://joelzaslofsky.com/free-personal-user-guide/) articles about this topic as well. With some practical examples like [A user manual for me](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694) with some questions and cards that can be filled out.

So, then there is the questions, why create this article?
I'm a developer, I like to understand a create systems. At this point in time I will soon be joining a company and would like to understand myself a bit better in that context. I would also like to understand myself in other types of relations. This combined with me recently doing a [big 5 analysis](https://discovermyprofile.com/?utm_source=centre) and wanting to incorporate that resulted in this document.
