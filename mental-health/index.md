# A pragmatic approach to mental health

At this point, we know quite a bit about what can affect our mental health. We also know that about 50% of us are going to struggle with mental health issues sometime during our lives. Our biggest problems are too dear to reach out for help, and to find the right help in the first place. This guide aims to be pragmatic, to give a list of things you can try to adjust to improve your own well-being and to search out the right help for you.

There are plenty of services that do this, what I hope to achieve with this guide is to provide a more holistic approach and to help you sort out some factors that are often overlooked in my experience. These factors relate to the fact that our mental health is in fact, not just in our head. The meat robot that carries around our brain all day also get to affect our mental health and we need to give it better working conditions.

The pragmatic approach to mental health is therefore:

- Talk with your doctor - they know a lot about meat robots - get a checkup and blodwork done. Deficiencies can be a contributing factor.
- Talk to a therapist - see if it is for you - it can probably help make the next actions easier as resolving trauma can make it easier for us to take care of our meat robots - wich will quite often improve our mental health - The section about therapy will give you 5 good scientificly backed reasons for why therapy work and some help with avoiding the common traps
- Take a look at your diet - the leading cause of deciese in the west these days is what you put in your mouth.
- Take a look at your stress levels
- Take a look at imflamation factors in your life
- Take a look at your exercise - outlive
- Take a look at your sleep - do you get 7-9 hours a night of okish quality?
- Take a look at your weight - as someone who has struggeled with weight a lot of my life, I'm sorry to have to go here - but fatcells can cause imflamation that can contribute to depression - if you are overweight, weightloss might help - but weightloss is a whole can of worm.
