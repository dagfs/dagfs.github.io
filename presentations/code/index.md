### Code is the language we express requirements in. It will not dissapear, but get more abstract and domain specific.

### Code rot

### developers responsibilities
* from cc
  * managers look to us for info to make commitments
  * users look to us that the requirements will fit into the system
  * project managers look to us to help fit the schedule
  * laws
  * code quality
  * go slow to go fast
  * broken video effect


### denormalization for better code

### using more resources than neccesarry
the payof of frameworks and libraries vs coding self to not usre more resources than neccessarry.
example include svg in html file so it is loaded many times instead of one time. big pictures that should be scaled.
