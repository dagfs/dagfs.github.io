# You are now thinking with design systems

## Summary

This talk will look into the ideas and processes at the core of design systems and how understanding them will benefit you and your team. 

The core idea of design systems is to have a framework for making and documenting decisions. The truth this talk will present is that no framework will replace collaboration and ownership, not even design systems.

This talk is for the teams that have a design system, want's to create one or think they are waste of time.

### outline

- Short intro to design systems
- Architecture Decision Record (ADR) and how design systems can be viewed as an extension of ADR 
  - Documentation of decisions
  - Discuss decisions
  - Unify the team
- Collaboration and ownership for developers and designers
  - Collaboration requires work
  - Design and development need to work together
  - We have to take ownership of the work we do and the decisions we take



### main points

I believe there are a few core concepts of design systems and that understanding them is beneficial for most developers.


#### A design system is a tool that is trying to improve the process

I believe that design systems are simply a tool to try to make processes easier. I'm sorry to say that using design systems well, requires working on your process and the collaboration between designers and developers.

Design systems are not a silver bullet. It is a tool that you can shoot yourself and everyone on your team in the foot with.


#### Consistency is important 

Having consistent UX is important to create a good user experience. Having consistent component APIs is important for developers that use your design and components.
 

#### To be consistent, save your decisions

To be consistent across people, through time, one has to have a system for storing your decisions. This is where a design system comes in. Living documentation of the decisions you have made.


#### Have intention behind your decisions 

The root of many of our problems with code and UX is that did not think through our decisions well. This affects everyone that looks at previous work. It often leads to multiple solutions for the same need creating bad user experiences.
