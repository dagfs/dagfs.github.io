# Project tips

These are project tips for commercial projects.

These tips are here to try to help you figure out what you can do to improve your project or get a nice start.
The tips will still require you to do the work as I can sadly not bootstrap ting for you as each project is different and things develops fast. My intention therefore is to share what I have learned and want to consider for the projects I am working on myself. My hope is that what is shared here will stand time better than some "this is the perfect template to your projects" kind of thing. 








### TODO
Id like to get a better understanding of the licenses available on github so it can be easy to pick a license for a project.
