# Meditation

This is a collection of thoughts about meditation. These ideas are by no means original. I will try to cite my sources for them when I am able to find them, but it will be hard as this is the result of hour, upon hours of reading, movies, podcasts and conversations.

The main sources are the podcasts "The Tim Ferris show". The youtube channel "The school of life". The movies "Inside out", "Soul", "Turning Red". The books "The body keeps the score".

## Finding home

The Pixar movie "Turning Red" talks about a lot of topics about growing up. There in learning how to regulate your emotions. In the movie Mei learns to find a place she can call home to return to when things in her life are overwhelming. It helps her calm down and face difficult situations during the day. If she does not manage to center herself, she will literally turn into a giant red panda. There are other important topics in this movie, but I was amazed at how well I felt they represented what finding a calm place to quiet onces mind is like.

In a podcast episode (I think it was Tim Ferris show #444 - With Hugh Jackman) I heard, they talk about how on reason to develop a morning meditation practice is to establish a mindset one can call "home". A mindset one can call upon to calm and quiet ones mind when it is needed, much like it is demonstrated by the move "Turning Red".


## Keep returning your focus

Dan Harris, has said that noticing that you are distracted and returning your focus to what you were focusing on is like a bicep curl. It helps you improve you focus and reduces the time you spend being distracted. I think this is important to talk about as it is so easy to start being mean to yourself when you start meditating. 

"You can not even keep your focus for three seconds, what is wrong with you?", is but one of the many thing we might say to ourselves when starting out. Doing this we quickly turn a practice that we want into something that is destructive.

So please keep this in mind. **If you manages to notice that you have lost your focus a few times during your meditation practice, even if you spend the rest of the time thinking of cute animals, then you have done very well indeed**. We all have to start out somewhere. Keep the expectations low. This is something that has to be worked on for some time. You are literally trying to change how your mind works. Just think of how many hours it has been doing what it has been doing and it starts making sense that it will take some time to change.


## Meditation and work

For some time I tried meditating at work to reduce stress. I was following what seemed like the popular and "right" way of doing it. But while I still think meditation and mindfulness are great tools for improving our lives. I do not believe they work that well as part of a workday. The main reason being that when meditating you bring yourself in contact with your feelings. While important, it can be quite distracting for your workday if you have lots of thing going on in your personal life. 

Do not expect to come out a meditation session calm. If you are experienced and do not have that many things going on in your life, you might find a calm place. If you are unexperienced or have a lot of uncomfortable thing going on in your life, then it is to be expected to become tired and returning from the session in a rather off centered fashion. Even though this will be uncomfortable in the moment. These are thing that you will be feelings that you should acknowledge at some point, as ignoring them only postpones when you have to deal with them.

I was not able to find an article I read a while back, but it seems that some companies missuses the mindfulness movement to put the responsibility on the workers to deal with their stress at work. Instead of trying to improve the workplaces and make reasonable working conditions for their employees, some companies gives mindfulness seminars and expects the workers to be able to manage better. Mindfulness can be useful, but when what you need are someone to look after your kids so you can teach other children during a pandemic, it falls way short.

## Breath work

If you come here for something you can use at work to calm yourself I suggest looking into how to activate your vagus nerve, which is part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is the part of your nervous system that relaxes you and bring you out of fight, flight, freeze.

Looking into and finding some breath work can also be a nice way of reducing  stress and calming your nervous system


## Self help is lucrative 

Mindfulness seems to be good business in general. So while it is useful. Keep in mind that a lot of good resources are available for free. [The mindfulness conspiracy](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality)
