# On thinking

It feels like every so ofter an article i read talks about a new way of thinking I have not heard of before. This note includes the different ways of thinking I have come across.


## Deductive reasoning
[Deductive reasoning]Deductive_reasoning] is a top-down approach to reasoning. Popularized in Sherlock Holmes, who technicly uses abductive reasoning.

In deductive reasoning one forms a chain of one or more premisses to reach a logical conclusion.

## Abductive reasoning
## Inductive reasoning
[Inductive reasoning][Inductive_reasoning] is a bottom-up approach to reasoning. Should not be confused with [mathematical induction][Mathematical_induction] where we prove that a statement is true for every natural number given a base case and an induction step. 

Inductive reasoning is described as using a limitided number of observations to generate a general truth, and can only give some evidence of the truth of the conclusions drawn.
