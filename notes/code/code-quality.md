# What is good code

* Error handeling strategy
* Easy to maintain
* good performance
* should read easy - metaphores that are easy to understand - paint picutre of what happends
* can be understood by others - after 2 weeks one forgets
* tests
* meaningfull names
* one way for doing things / one responsebility
* low in coupling and high in cohesion
* duplicated code dry vs fowler
* how to write code
  1 write it so it works
  2 refactor
    * duplication
    * names
  3 go back and see if it can be improved after some time (next time in file or working on the same problem)
* dont be afraind to rename
* separation of concern
* use abstractions to hide implimentation details for flexibility
* the code does not lie - it does what it says
* you spend more time reading than writing code. take that into account
* the boy scout rule

## writing good code
* make good abstractions early vs when neccesarry - refactoring
