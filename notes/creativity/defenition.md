## Define creativity - usikker pÃ¥ denne delen

Just to make sure we are on the same page, I want to try to explain what I mean 
when I think of creativity.

Oxford Languages defined creativity as:
> the use of imagination or original ideas to create something; inventiveness.
>
>-- <cite>Oxford Languages</cite>

What is an original idea is a hot potato of a topic as so much of what we humans do is a 
remix of ideas. This is highlighted by *Kirby Ferguson* in his documentary [Everything is a Remix](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/).

To dig deeper in this defenition. Ideas are toughts, and thougts [TODO finn er fornuftig kilde] and thoughts are the results of different external and internal stimulus. 

Putting these two togheter one can argue creativity is generating ideas based on what you know combined with some external stimulus, such as a problem to solve. One thing to add, is that we seldom go for the first idea that pops into our head. We need to do a few iterations.

## Define creativity [presentation-only]

There is a somewhat know quote about creativity by Dilbert creator *Scott Adams*

> Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep.
>
> -- <cite>Scott Adams</cite>

Failing is overused and popuralized by Silicon Valley [todo kilde - Adam savage?]. 
What we often mean when we say failing, is simply iterating. It often takes a few tries to get things right. That does not mean you fail for each iterations. The goal of the first few iterations is simply to learn.

> Creativity is solving a problem trough an iterative process where both the problem and the solutions evolve. Art is knowing when to stop iterating and what to keep. 

> Creativity is an iterative process where both the problem and the solution evolve resulting in new ideas and solutions. 

As in any iterative process we learn something by participating in it.
