# Licences

Graphana - switches to AGPL - It has never been tried in court

## types:
 

### Products
docker, runtimes, infrastructures - paying - figma - free vs payed. self hosted - support etc
ok to solve

### development
editors
a bit harder
can use tools without paying for it

*if you are using a tool at work and there is a payed version. you should probably used the payed version*


### libraries 
richard stolman - run if he supports it

most of what we use at work are free open source licenses

libraries from reposotories such as nuget, maven, npm are mostly okay
are used by many

liberal licences ISC, Apache, CC, MIT and BSD

chooese a license.com

disclose source should make lights blink


much is guesswork. things that has not been tried in court is guesswork for everyone

GPL - not that good
LGPL - pretty okay 
AGPL - disclose source


lisensiering kan være for inntekt, ideologi, eller for å beskytte bedrifter "corporate shennanigans". Facebook - if any part of google uses react - no part of google can sue facebook for patents

use license controllers

- license-checker dotnet-project-licenses license-maven-plugin


whitliste licenses
mit, isc, bsd-2-clause, apache-2.0, bsd-3-clause,0bsd,cc0-1.0

greylist

blacklist


some tools as linters are agpl - but you run them on your code not part of your code so it is proabably ok


### Attribution
list opensource libraries

normal to not do

sounds interesting - proabably not worth the wait


## takeaways

- hvis du bruker et verktøy som en kan betale for faller vi nok innafor det vi skal betale
- lisenssjekker
- ha en license side
- if you follow the intention of the creator - you are probably ok - if you try to avoid paying - then you are the on shaky ground
