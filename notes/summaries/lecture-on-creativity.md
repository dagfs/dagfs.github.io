# Short summary of John Cleese's “Lecture On Creativity” (with a few anecdotes)
 
In [Lecture On Creativity][0] John Cleese argue that to be able to be creative one has to be in an “open” state. Normally in everyday life, at work, at home, one are in a “closed” state where you just get things done. One does not need to be creative or original to fold your towels, You just need to get it done. It is navigation. In the “open” state you are more playful. 
He further argues that there are a few conditions making it more likely you get into the “open” condition, and can also prevent it from being able to enter the “open” condition if not present. 

The conditions are:

**Space** - a place where you can work without being disturbed. A place to play.

**Time** - You need a windows of time where you know you can work undisturbed. But it should not be too long. 1.5 hours is a good time as it can take up to 30 min to enter the “open” state.

**Time** - You need time to work a problem. Creating original solutions requires pushing at a problem in a comfortable manner. When it gets hard one need to be able to relax a bit and start pushing softly again as to not get stuck. If you do not have the time to work on a problem for some time it is easy to go for a simple solution, which is not what we want when we try to be creative.

In the talk [The surprising habits of original thinkers][1], Adam Grant talks about how original thinkers procrastinate. That they work the problem for the longest time available to them before starting on the solution. And because of this can come up with more original, creative solutions than those who solve the problem right away.

**Confidence** - having the confidence to share. 

**Humor** - Humor makes us playful, this in turn makes it easier to get into the “open” state.

These conditions can make it simpler to be creative, but they are not a guarantee. Creativity is hard work.

To end with some playfulness i want to mention Adam Savage talk [My obsession with objects and the stories they tell][3]. His talk always gives me energy and
