# Project Pareto Hats

This project aims to provide 20% of the knowledge for the common tasks in a modern software development project that are not coding related. As to provide teams in all sizes, but particularly small sizes with the tools needed to 

The project is guided by the **Pareto principle** and **Parkinson's law**

>The **Pareto principle** states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few").[1] Other names for this principle are the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity.

[Wikipedia: Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)

>**Parkinson's law** is the adage that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."

[Wikipedia: Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)

The project is guided by Parkinson's law by operating under strict time limits as to get trough the intended material.

## Project outline
The project will spend 4-6 hours a month on a topic trying to summarize and share the most important information about each topic. The first month will be spent gathering topics to explore and materials to read. There will also be a one month vacation. So a total of 10 topics will be explored.

Each topic will receive it's own sub-page where working notes will be collected. It will be a place to go for deeper exploration of each topic. The summary of each topic will be brought back to this page as to provide a singe page resource.  


*Everything beneath the line is WIP*
