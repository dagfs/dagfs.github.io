## Hats in software development

This is the working pages for the first month of project Pareto Hats where the different types of tasks on a project (outside of coding-related tasks) along with some resources are collected.

My strategy for identifying different hats to explore is to look at lists I've compiled before, online lists, ask in groupchats that I am part of and talk with experienced people about important skills that is often overlooked in software development projects. I will also ask about recourses that people have found important to them trough their careerers and see what they are about.

Once the list of possible topics has grown long, I'll look trough and select 10 I find interesting and that I've gotten some good articles to explore. I will then start exploring the material I have, along with material I find by myself, by asking for articles and talking with people experienced in the topic.

Once I've explored each topic for a certain amount of time, I'll summarize what I have learned and bring it back to the main document.

I expect that multiple topics will be explored at the same time as many do overlap and I'll make sure to write down what I find for topics I'm not currently working on. But my goal is to focus on exploring one topic at a time as to spend a fixed amount of time exploring it to learn the most important things in a short amount of time.
