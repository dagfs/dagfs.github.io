# 8. Privacy

Privacy is a human right. "I got nothing to hide" just does not cut it. The information we keep about the users of our services is our responsibility. Losing or sharing it puts our users in harms way. It is vital to understand why and how to do these things properly.

Universal Declaration of Human Rights article 12

> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument

> Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.
