# 3. Teams
Almost no work is done utterly by yourself. Most work is done in collaborations with multiple people. Exploring team dynamics and how to contribute, and take advantage of teams better seems like a worthwhile endeavor. There are also quite a few books on the topic I would like to read.

What should every team know and do about teams.



## Psychological safety

Psyhological safety is about feeling that you are accepted and respected in a setting. Being in a team setting, team members thinks less of negative consequenses of expressing ideasa and challenging the status quo.  

Having psychological safety has show to be important for interdependent teams working on problems without one clear solution. Without being able to trust the other team members or feel safe to share your ideas, it makes a great deal of sense that a team would not work well.

Teams with psychological safety have a more open enviroment and are able to talk about problems to a greater degree than teams lacking psychological safety.

We want to strive to be in the Learning zone as it is the zone where we can get the most done and feel well. 

| Accoutability for performance | Low          | High          |                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
|                               | Comfort Zone | Learning Zone | High                 |
|                               | Apathy Zone  | Anexiety Zone | Low                  |
|                               |              |               | Psychological Safety |

The framework ["the four stages of psychological safety"](https://www.leaderfactor.com/4-stages-of-psychological-safety) gives us a startingpoint for how to work with psychological safety in our teams. The four stages are:

1. Inclusion Safety - Do I feel accepted and included just by being me?
2. Learning Safety - Do I feel like I can ask questions and get help?
3. Contributor Safety - Do I feel like the work I do is respected?
4. Challenger Safety - Do I feel like I can disagree on decitions in the team?

What is interesting about these four "stages" or areas, as one can also think of them, is that minor intereaction can hurt them. All it takes is someone having to much to do, or having a bad day, responding irritated to a question. A few interactions like that can damage the individuals psychological safety.

## Givers and takers

Givers and takers is a book by the organistational psychologist Adam Grant. I do reccomend chaking out his podcast [Adam Grant: Worklife](). In the book he talks about different strategies to life. Givers are people who give without asking. You know them, they often get taken advantage of. Takers are people who takes more than they give back (just ask, who is the asshole and you'll find them). You probably also know of a few. People employing this strategy to life will soon find that a lot of people will cut them out of their lives as they never get anything in return. The main part of the population however, are matchers. They look at what others do and match that. This makes it so things are fair and they never get screwed over to badly. 

Studies has shown that the people employing the giving strattegy to life ends up on top, and bottom in life.

Organisations has great benefit of employing people living by the giving approach to life. They make the work work. So one might think that one should focus on hiering givers, but studies has show that it is more important to avoid hiering takers.

For more about giving and teaking i reccomend chacking out the game [evolution of trust](https://ncase.me/trust/) witch**** explains game theory.
