# Project Pareto 

This project aims to provide 20% of the knowledge for the common tasks in a modern software development project that are not coding related. As to provide teams in all sizes, but particularly small sizes with the tools needed to 

The project is guided by the **Pareto principle**, **Parkinson's law** and the idea of **The Learning pyramid**

>The **Pareto principle** states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few").[1] Other names for this principle are the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity.

>**Parkinson's law** is the adage that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."

[Wikipedia: Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)

The project is guided by Parkinson's law by operating under strict time limits as to get trough the intended material.


>**The Learning Pyramid** is a group of popular learning models and representations relating different degrees of retention induced from various type of learning.

>Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test.

## Project outline
The project will spend 4-6(1.5+3.5) hours a month on a topic trying to summarize and share the most important information about each topic. The first month will be spent gathering topics to explore and materials to read. There will also be a one month vacation. So a total of 10 topics will be explored.

Each topic will receive it's own sub-page where working notes will be collected. It will be a place to go for deeper exploration of each topic. The summary of each topic will be brought back to this page as to provide a singe page resource.  

## Topics in software development (January)

The first part of Project Pareto was identifying topics to explore. The following chapters where the identified topics.

*Everything beneath the line is WIP*

## 1. Learning (February)
We are doing knowledge work. Our job is to learn things. But there is such a thing as beginner experts and fixed mindsets. Looking into how to learn and adapt what I learn from this project seems like an obvious place to start.

## 2. Free and open-source software - FOSS (March)
The world is running on FOSS. I want to understand how this works better and see how I can help contribute to make it more sustainable.

## 3. Teams
Almost no work is done utterly by yourself. Most work is done in collaborations with multiple people. Exploring team dynamics and how to contribute, and take advantage of teams better seems like a worthwhile endeavor. There are also quite a few books on the topic I would like to read.

## 4. Understanding the users
As an IT-consultant I usually have to understand both the business goals of the company my contracted by and the needs of their users that I am to serve. Learning more about how to understand the users and the tools used to do so seems crucial to deliver the most value.

## 5. Understanding the customer
As an IT-consultant I usually have to understand both the business goals of the company my contracted by and the needs of their users that I am to serve. Learning more about how to understand the customer and the tools used to do so seems crucial to deliver the most value.

## 6. Design
Understanding users is not enough. We also need to know how to design things that solves their problems. Understanding grapichal design and user experience design to some degree is important.

## 7. Accessability
While understanding a bit of design is important. It is vital to understand that to be a fair and inclusive spechies, we need to assure accesability for people all kinds of challenges. Most of us has to some degree some kind of challenge. And temporary conditions requireing some consideration outside of normal is even more common. Taking accessebility into account also improves the experience and gives benefits to thouse not affected by the challenges the guidelines was concerned with.

## 8. Privacy
Privacy is a human right. "I got nothing to hide" just does not cut it. The information we keep about the users of our services is our responsibility. Losing or sharing it puts our users in harms way. It is vital to understand why and how to do these things properly.

[Working notes](./8-privacy)


## 9. Security
To keep our users and customers safe we need to understand a base level of security. I want to learn more about common problems and how to check for vulnerabilities in the projects I work on.

[Working notes](./9-security)


## 10. Mentoring
We are all mentors in some capacity. Being a good colleague or partner is important. I hope to learn more about this topic as I talk with people trough the year, that is why I want to do this topic as late as possible to incorporate what I learn into this topic.

[Working notes](./10-mentoring)


## 11. Self
We are all humans that have to deal with emotions and stress. I put this topic last as it is one I continually learn about even outside of this project so I wanted to tackle it last as it is when I feel like I have to most to share.
