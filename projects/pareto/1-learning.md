# 1. Learning
We are knowledge workers. So the obvious place to start is to look into how to
learn things better and get into new topics faster.

We will get into some Concepts and ideas as well as some tips for how to get 
into new projects fast.

## Concepts and ideas

There are a few concepts and ideas I think are useful to know about:
- Growth VS fixed mindset
- Guided VS unguided learning
- Spaced repetition
- The Feynman Learning Technique
- Writing to learn
- Failing
- Iteration
- Dunning–Kruger
- Beginner expert
- Use multiple sources


### Growth VS fixed mindset
A growth mindset is simply a mindset where you believe you can grow and improve
yourself. With a fix mindset you believe you are a certain way and can not
change.

It is really easy to slip into thinking you are a certain way to avoid the
uncomfortable feeling of having to learn something you do not particularly like.
So try to catch yourself when you think "I can not do this". Try to reframe it
to "I can not do this, yet".

For more about growth mindset see the TED talk [The power of believing that you
can improve - Carol Dweck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU)

### Guided VS unguided learning
When learning something new it is a good idea to try to use a combination of
guided and unguided learning. Unguided learning is a lot of what we do everyday.
Looking up random bits of information that we need. Were as guided learning is a
more structured approach that gives you a better foundation of a topic.

I find that I often try to solve topics that does not interest me by unguided
learning only. Ending up with things taking longer than needed and me getting
frustrated because I am looking up one random problem after another without
understanding how anything works.

This week I noticed this happening and ended up finally looking up a video
explaining how the ubiquitous tool I had avoided learning works.

Josh W. Comeau has an excellent article about learning where he talks about
[guided vs unguided
learning.](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-to-learn-stuff-quickly/) 

### Spaced repetition
If you want to learn something and remember it well you will on most occasions
need to refresh what you have learned. Spaced repetition is a technique were you
learn something, then repeat it with longer and longer intervals between. This
technique uses the forgetting curve theory, which is a theory that once you
learn something, that information slowly degrades over time til you no longer
can recall it. To prevent this you make sure to refresh the information before
it is no longer recoverable. By refreshing the information near the end of the
time period you are able to recall it, you extend how long you remember it for
the next period. This means at some point, the chances of the information you
have learned refreshing itself by natural situations are high. By refreshing, I
simply mean brining the information to mind if you are able to recall it. Or if
you can no longer remember it, looking in up to remember it for next time.

At work this is often naturally reenforced as the important topics are repeated
before you have time to forget them. But for topics you do not use often, having
a system in place to remember the details might be helpful. Having some notes to
review once every 3 months to make the next tax return a bit easier for example.

It is common to use apps and flashcards as tools when using this method.

For more about spaced repetition see [Spaced Repetition: The most powerful study
technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uMMRjrzPmE) 

### The Feynman Learning Technique

One of the best ways to learn something is the [Feynman technique](
https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/).

Try to teach what you want to learn to someone to figure out what you do not
understand well enough. Learn more about what you don't understand. Improve your
explanation of what you know. It is easy to think you know something. It is
first when you try to use the knowledge you will find that you do not understand
it well enough. Trying to teach it to someone, and particularly to children,
will challenge you as you have to explain it in really simple terms witch can
only be achieved if you understand the topic well enough. 

The Feynman method is part of the rationale for me to do this project. By trying
to summaries the topics to teach them I get to learn them myself.

### Writing to learn
>Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that
you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe
test. Paul Graham -
[http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html)

Writing to learn things follows the last principle to some degree. It doesn't
quite enforce it quite as much, but there are great benefits in testing your
knowledge by writing down what you know. It is by talking, writing and sharing
our ideas we get to think and explore our ideas.

80-120 character lines seems to be better for writing prose as well as code. It
is easier to get an understanding for the whole line of text before the one you
are writing so it is easier to edit and review.

For more about writing with character limits see [Write thin to write fast](https://breckyunits.com/write-thin-to-write-fast.html)

### Failing
While it can be scary and feel bad to fail, it is also am important part of
learning. In some context I am sure you do it and find it easy. "What happens if
I pase these value, will I get the results I expect?". While in other situations
it can be painful.

According to the article [The Eighty Five Percent Rule for optimallearning(Nature)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4#:~:text=That%20is%2C%20the%20optimal%20error,Percent%20Rule%20for%20optimal%20learning.),
learning is optimized when succeeding 85% of the time. Or to put it into other
words, have an error/ failing rate of about 15 to 1/6 tries.

So do not be afraid to fail.

### Iteration

While doing something while knowing you might fail, there is an easy change of
mindset we can do to make it be less scary and hurt less. If we approach life
with the mindset that everything is iterations. What ever you do, it is not the
final attempt. It is just iteration one of maybe hundreds.

Life is so much easier if you figure you have to do things 3 times before you do
them right. It makes it so much easier to learn from it. So instead at looking
at something you attempted, saying that you failed and never doing it again.
Look at it and thing this was version 1, what can I learn from it to improve
version 2.

Adam Savage mentions iterations and celebrating them in some of his videos about
making. And in his book "Every tool is a hammer", he references Pixar and their
iterative processes of rewriting their whole manuscripts several times.

### Dunning–Kruger
> The Dunning–Kruger effect is the cognitive bias whereby people with low
ability at a task overestimate their ability. From [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect#:~:text=The%20Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger%20effect%20is,tendency%20to%20underestimate%20their%20skills.)
on Wikipedia

Go and have a look at the graph illustrating the concept, it is really
interesting. The cognitive bias explains why it is easy to think you know more
about something than you do and why learning can be painful as it requires you
to acknowledge that you do not know something and by doing so my find that you
know very little about the topic. 

### Beginner expert

There is a rather know software development article that gets shared every now
and then called [How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/).
It is a really good read so I do recommend giving it a read. It expands on the
Dunning–Kruger effect and shows what can happen if you do not manage to break
free from it.

You get to a point where you feel you are an expert and then refuse to learn 
more of face that you do not know enough as it can be painful to acknowledge
that you don't know something.


### Use multiple sources 
> Truth is an assembled thing
>
> &mdash; [Russell A. Barkley](https://blog.apabooks.org/2016/10/31/a-conversation-with-russell-a-barkley-phd-about-adult-adhd/)

To learn something new, it is in general beneficial to use multiple sources.
Part of it to verify the information, part is to get different explanations of
the same concept. I also try to combine reading books books, articles, podcasts,
videos and talking with people to expand my understanding of a topic 



## Getting into new projects

There are many occasions in life where getting into a topic or a project fast can be to great benefit.

### Write a dictionary
Writing down terminology used in a project in your own words helps you see what
you do not fully understand. Ask people around you to fill in what you are
missing.

While it is useful to share this sort of information with the others working on the project, it still makes sense to make a dictionary for yourself as you have to write using your own words challenging your understanding of the terms to the point you have to ask for clarifications before you are able to write them down.

### Ask questions 
Ask questions til you understand. If you are in a meeting, maybe write down what
you do not understand and take it after the meeting. Or if you think others
don't know either, ask to make sure everyone is on the same page. Given that
what you do not understand is important for that context.

- Why is it like this?
- Is there a particular reason it is like this?
- What edge cases were you thinking of?
- What is causing the most problems?
- What are the most used features?


### Within what frameworks is the project performed?

Learn what are the frameworks and restrictions the projects is performed within. How approves what is finished? What is the goal of the project? What is the goal of what is above the project? What is the goal of the organization doing the project?

Try to see the bigger picture. While there is usually someone that is trying to move the project along in the right direction, they might be focusing only on some parts and not the overall goals. Or they might not understand the technologies involved. Understanding the bigger picture is therefore important as to contribute and make good long term decisions for the project.



### Read trough existing documents
Read trough existing documentation and take notes. Note things you need to
explore further. Write down pain points, needs and wishes.

Reading trough the history of a project gives you great insight to what has already been done. It also gives you the opportunity to see what the goals was starting out, allowing you to question the current goals if they have changed since the project started out.
