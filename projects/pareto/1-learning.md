# 1. Learning
We are knowledge workers. So the obvious place to start is to look into how to learn things better and get into new topics faster.



## Concepts and ideas

There are a few concepts and ideas I think are useful to know about:
- Growth VS fixed mindset
- Guided VS unguided learning
- Spaced repetition
- The Feynman Learning Technique
- Writing to learn
- Failing
- Iteration
- Dunning–Kruger
- Beginner expert
- Use multiple sources


### Growth VS fixed mindset
A growth mindset is simply a mindset where you believe you can grow and improve yourself. With a fix mindset you believe you are a certain way and can not change.

It is really easy to slip into thinking you are a certain way to avoid the uncomfortable feeling of having to learn something you do not particularly like. So try to catch yourself when you think "I can not do this". Try to reframe it to "I can not do this, yet".

For more about growth mindset see the TED talk [The power of believing that you can improve - Carol Dweck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU)

### Guided VS unguided learning
When learning something new it is a good idea to try to use a combination of guided and unguided learning. Unguided learning is a lot of what we do everyday. Looking up random bits of information that we need. Were as guided learning is a more structured approach that gives you a better foundation of a topic.

I find that I often try to solve topics that does not interest me by unguided learning only. Ending up with things taking longer than needed and me getting frustrated because I am looking up one random problem after another without understanding how anything works.

This week I noticed this happening and ended up finally looking up a video explaining how the ubiquitous tool I had avoided learning works.

Josh W. Comeau has an excellent article about learning where he talks about [guided vs unguided learning.](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-to-learn-stuff-quickly/) 

### Spaced repetition
If you want to learn something and remember it well you will on most occasions need to refresh what you have learned. Spaced repetition is a technique were you learn something, then repeat it with longer and longer intervals between. 

At work this is often naturally reenforced as the important topics are repeated before you have time to forget them. But for topics you do not use often, having a system in place to remember the details might be helpful. Having some notes to review once every 3 months to make the next tax return a bit easier for example.

### The Feynman Learning Technique

One of the best ways to learn something is the [Feynman technique](
https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/).

Try to teach what you want to learn to someone to figure out what you do not understand well enough. Learn more about what you don't understand. Improve your explanation of what you know. It is easy to think you know something. It is first when you try to use the knowledge you will find that you do not understand it well enough. Trying to teach it to someone, and particularly to children, will challenge you as you have to explain it in really simple terms witch can only be achieved if you understand the topic well enough. 

The Feynman method is part of the rationale for me to do this project. By trying to summaries the topics to teach them I get to learn them myself.

### Writing to learn
>Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test.
Paul Graham - [http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html)

Writing to learn things follows the last principle to some degree. It dosent quite enforce it quite as much, but there are great benefits in testing your knowledge by writing down what you know. It is by talking, writing and sharing our ideas we get to think and explore our ideas.

80-120 character lines seems to be better for writing prose as well as code. It is easier to get an understanding for the whole line of text before the one you are writing so it is easier to edit.

### Failing
While it can be scary and feel bad to fail, it is also am important part of learning. In some context I am sure you do it and find it easy. "What happens if I pase these value, will I get the results I expect?". While in other situations it can be painful.

According to the article [The Eighty Five Percent Rule for optimal learning(Nature)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12552-4#:~:text=That%20is%2C%20the%20optimal%20error,Percent%20Rule%20for%20optimal%20learning.), learning is optimized when succeeding 85% of the time. Or to put it into other words, have an error/ failing rate of about 15 or 1/6 tries.

So do not be afraid to fail.

### Iteration

While doing something while knowing you might fail, there is an easy change of mindset we can do to make it be less scary and hurt less. If we approach life with the mindset that everything is iterations. What ever you do, it is not the final attempt. It is just iteration one of maybe hundreds.

Life is so much easier if you figure you have to do things 3 times before you do them right. It makes it so much easier to learn from it. So instead at looking at something you attempted, saying that you failed and never doing it again. Look at it and thing this was version 1, what can I learn from it to improve version 2.

Adam Savage mentions iterations and celebrating them in some of his videos about making. And in his book "Every tool is a hammer", he references Pixar and their iterative processes of rewriting their whole manuscripts several times.

### Dunning–Kruger
> The Dunning–Kruger effect is the cognitive bias whereby people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.
From [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect#:~:text=The%20Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger%20effect%20is,tendency%20to%20underestimate%20their%20skills.) on Wikipedia

Go and have a look at the graph illustrating the concept, it is really interesting. The cognitive bias explains why it is easy to think you know more about something than you do and why learning can be painful as it requires you to acknowledge that you do not know something and by doing so my find that you know very little about the topic. 

### Beginner expert


There is a rather know software development article that gets shared every now and then called [How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/). It is a really good read so I do recommend giving it a read. It expands on the Dunning–Kruger effect and shows what can happen if you do not manage to break free from it.


### Use multiple sources 
> Truth is an assembled thing
>
> &mdash; [Russell A. Barkley](https://blog.apabooks.org/2016/10/31/a-conversation-with-russell-a-barkley-phd-about-adult-adhd/)

To learn something new, it is in general beneficial to use multiple sources. Part of it to verify the information, part is to get different explanations of the same concept. I also try to combine reading books books, articles, podcasts, videos and talking with people to expand my understanding of a topic

## Getting into new projects

### Write a dictionary
Writing down terminology used in a project in your own words helps you see what you do not fully understand. Ask people around you to fill in what you are missing.

### Ask questions 
Ask questions til you understand. If you are in a meeting, maybe write down what you do not understand and take it after the meeting. Or if you think others don't know eighter, askt to make sure everyone is on the same page. Given that what you do not understand is important for that context.

- Why is it like this?
- Is there a particular reason it is liek this? https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/
- What edcases were you thinking of?
- What is causing the most problems?
- What are the most used features?

### What is the flow in the firm?

Ask someone to explain the flow of the project with you
Take notes and go trough things again a few weeks later.
Try to go trough the system all the way.

You can document this creating an overview of the system from beginning to end. 

- What do the company do?
- What comes in?
    - What data does it contain?

Use DDD to model the firm

### Tildelingsbrev
Some companies has documents documenting challenges, goals and priorities.

### Read trough existing documents
Read trough exisitng documentation and take notes. Note things you need to explore futher. Write down pain points, needs and wishes.
