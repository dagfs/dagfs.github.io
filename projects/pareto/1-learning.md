# 1. Learning
We are knowledge workers. So the obvious place to start is to look into how to learn things better and get into new topics faster.



## Concepts and ideas

There are a few concepts and ideas I think are useful to know about:
- Growth VS fixed mindset
- Guided VS unguided learning
- Spaced repetition
- The Feynman Learning Technique
- Failing
- Beginner expert
- Dunning–Kruger


### Growth VS fixed mindset
A growth mindset is simply a mindset where you believe you can grow and improve yourself. With a fix mindset you believe you are a certain way and can not change.

It is really easy to slip into thinking you are a certain way to avoid the uncomfortable feeling of having to learn something you do not particularly like. So try to catch yourself when you think "I can not do this". Try to reframe it to "I can not do this, yet".

For more about growth mindset see the TED talk [The power of believing that you can improve | Carol Dweck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU)

### Guided VS unguided learning
When learning something new it is a good idea to try to use a combination of guided and unguided learning. Unguided learning is a lot of what we do everyday. Looking up random bits of information that we need. Were as guided learning is a more structured approach that gives you a better fundation of a topic.

I find that I often try to solve topics that does not interest me by unguided learning only. Ending up with things taking longer than needed and me getting frustrated because I am looking up one random problem after another without understanding how anything works.

This week I noticed this happening and ended up finally looking up a video explaining how the ubiquitous tool I had avoided learning works.

Josh W. Comeau has an excellent article about learning where he talks about [guided vs unguided learning.](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-to-learn-stuff-quickly/) 

### Spaced repetition
If you want to learn something and remember it well you will on most occasions need to refresh what you have learned. Spaced repetition is a technique were you learn something, then repeat it with longer and longer intervals between. 

At work this is often naturally reenforced as the important topics are repeated before you have time to forget them. But for topics you do not use often, having a system in place to remember the details might be helpful. Having some notes to review once every 3 months to make the next tax return a bit easier for example.

### The Feynman Learning Technique

One of the best ways to learn something is the Feynman technique.

It can be explained as:

1. Find something you want to learn about
2. Explain it to a kid
3. Think about what you could not explain properly and what you could have explained better.
4. Fin

Choose a concept you want to learn about
Explain it to a 12 year old
Reflect, Refine, and Simplify
Organize and Review

>Writing about something, even something you know well, usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. Putting ideas into words is a severe test.

- think again

### Getting into new projects

#### Write a dictionary
Writing down terminology used in a project in your own words helps you see what you do not fully understand. Ask people around you to fill inn what you are missing.

#### Ask questions 
Ask questions til you understand. If you are in a meeting, maybe write down what you do not understand and take it after the meeting. Or if you think others don't know eighter, askt to make sure everyone is on the same page. Given that what you do not understand is important for that context.

- Why is it like this?
- Is there a particular reason it is liek this? https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/
- What edcases were you thinking of?
- What is causing the most problems?
- What are the most used features?

#### Whats the flow in the firm?

Ask someone to explain the flow of the project with you
Take notes and go trough things again a few weeks later.
Try to go trough the system all the way.

You can document this creating an overview of the system from beginning to end. 

- What do the company do?
- What comes in?
    - What data does it contain?

Use DDD to model the firm
