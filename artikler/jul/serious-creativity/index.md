# Serious creativity

Edward De Bono has researched creativity for more than 50 years and collected his knowledge in the book *Serious creativity*. This article is a summary of some of the key points as I have come to understand them. 

## What is creativity?
We have perceptions, concepts, and boundaries that we believe to be true, creativity is about challenging these. Creativity is about breaking patterns and giving us an alternative approach to logical thinking in pursuit of solving problems. With creativity, we move beyond what is and into what could be. 

## Misconceptions
There are many misconceptions about creativity that hold us back from embracing creativity.
- That creativity is something you are born with and not something you can learn. 
- That you have to be artistic to be creative. 
- That creativity is a bit crazy and illogical. 
- That certain conditions make you creative.
- That creativity is something you have to do as a group.

These are wrong and are holding us back. It seems like there is a scale going from logical to creative and that many don't feel like they can identify as creative. 

The misconception regarding conditions that makes you creative is not entirely wrong. Everyday hassles inhibit us from being creative, and eliminating them by arranging the right conditions makes it easier to be creative. 


## What is the difference between logical and creative thinking?
To look at the difference, we first need to know a bit about how the brain works. 
The brain is a self-organizing information system. That is, it collects and organizes information on the fly. "Knobs" are a common term used to describe when new information fits nicely into the system the brain has organized. Previous knowledge and the order of new information affect how the information is stored.

Knowing this makes it easier to see that what we think of logical thinking is fragile. By logical thinking, we start with a problem and resonate with a solution by navigating information our brain has connected with the problem. This is normally efficient as we have solved similar problems before, but when there are novel problems, we might get stuck in unhelpful patterns. 

Creative thinking helps us break free from these patterns and navigate our knowledge in different ways. By using techniques as "random input" and "provocation". We can change where we start our thinking process and therefore end up with other solutions than we could be logical thinking. You know you have found a reasonable solution when the solution seems logical in hindsight. 


## Random input and provocation
Random input and provocation are just two of the many creative techniques that can be applied to think creatively.

Random input is a method where a list of random input, usually words, but photos could work too, is collected and shared one item at a time. The person ideating thinks of a problem and uses the random input to affect the ideas they generate. The random input helps you break the logical patterns one is used to follow and forces you take detours through other topics that might logically feel unrelated but can spark new logical ideas.

Provocation works similarly as random input. By providing a provocation that might seem illogical, and taking the time to resonate on the provocation and look at the implications it causes, one can come up with ideas outside of our usual patterns. This can be thought of like 30 seconds of madness. Give your random crazy thoughts the same treatment as the ideas you feel seems logical.
