# Serious creativity

Edward De Bono has researched creativity for more than 50 years and collected his knowledge in the book *Serious creativity*. This is a summary of some of the key points as I have come to understand them. 

## What is creativity
We have certain perceptions, concepts and boundaries that we belive to be true, 
creativity is about challenging these. Creativity is about breaking patterns and giving us an alternative approach to locical thinking in pursuit to solve problems. With creativity, we move beyond what is, and into what could be. 

## Missconceptions
There are many missconceptions about creativity that hold us back from embraising creativity.
- That creativity is something you are born with, and can not be learned. 
- That you have to be artistic to be creative. 
- That creativity is a bit crazy and ilogical. 
- That there are certain condition that needs to be meet in order to be creative.
- That creativity is something you have to do as a group.

These are wrong and are holding us back. It seems like there is a scale going from logical to creative and that many don't feel like they can identify as creative. 


## What is the difference between logical and creative thinking?
To look at the difference, we first need to  know a bit about how the brain works. 
The brain is a self-organising information system. That is it collects and organises 
information on the fly. "Knobs" are a common term used to describe when new information
fits nicely into the system the brain has organised. Previous knowledge and
the the order of new information affects how the information is stored.

Knowing this makes it easier to see that what we think of locial thinking is fragile. By logical thinking we start with a problem and resonate to a solution by navigating information our brain has connected with the problem. This is normaly efficent as we have solved similar problems before, but when there are novel problems, we might get stuck in unhelpfull patterns. 

Creative thinking helps us breake free from these eficent patterns and navigate our knowledge in different ways. By using techniques as "random input", and "provocation", we can change where we start our thinking process and therefore end up with other solutions than we could be locical thinking. You know you have found a reasonlable solution when the solution seems logical in heinsight. 


## Random input and provocation
Random input and provocation are just two of many creative techniques that can be applied to think creativly.

Random input is a method were a list of random input, usually words, but photos could work to, is collected and shared one item at a time. The person ideating thinks of a problem and uses the random input to affect what ideas are generated. The random input helps you break the logical paterns one is used to follow, and forces you take detours through other topics that might logically feel unrelated, but can spark new logical ideas.

Provocation works in a similar way as random input. By providing a provocation that might seem highy illogical, and taking the time to resonate on the provocation and look at the implications it causes, one can come up with ideas outside of our normal patterns. This can be tought of as 30 seconds madness. Give your random crazy toughts the same treatment as the ideas you feel seems logical.




## Condtions
John Cleese has a talk about conditions to be creative. Thee conditions certaily makes it easier to be creative, but as De Bone points out, when these contioins are meet, we are not more creative than our normal level of creativity, but we are not imhibited from beeing creative by everyday hussles.

The condtions Cleese lists are:
