# Serious creativity

## What is creativity
We have certain perceptions, concepts and boundaries that we belive to be true, 
creativity is about challenging these. Creativity is about breaking patterns and giving us an alternative 
approach to locical thinking in pursuit to solve problems. With creativity, we move beond
what is, and into what could be. 

## Missconceptions
There are many missconceptions about creativity that hold us back from embraising creativity.
- That creativity is something you are born with, and can not be learned. 
- That you have to be artistic to be creative. 
- That creativity is a bit crazy and ilogical. 
- That there are certain condition that needs to be meet in order to be creative.
- That creativity is something you have to do as a group.

These are wrong and are holding us back. It seems like there is a scale going from logical to creative
and that many don't feel like they can identify as creative. 


## What is the difference between logical and creative thinking?
To look at the difference, we first need to  know a bit about how the brain works. 
The brain is a self-organising information system. That is it collects and organises 
information on the fly. "Knobs" are a common term used to describe when new information
fits nicely into the system the brain has organised. Previous knowledge and
the the order of new information affects how the information is stored.

Knowing this makes it easier to see that what we think of locial thinking is fragile. By logical thinking
we start with a problem and resonate to a solution by navigating information our brain has connected with the problem.
This is normaly efficent as we have solved similar problems before, but when there are novel problems,
we might get stuck in unhelpfull patterns. 

Creative thinking helps us breake free from these eficent patterns and navigate our knowledge in different ways.
By using techniques as "random input", and "provocation, we can change where we start our thinking process and 
therefore end up with other solutions than we could be locical thinking. You know you have found
a reasonlable solution when the solution seems logical in heinsight.
