# The scroll bar jump

So, you are working on a website. Some of the pages on the website are so long that
they cause the scroll bar to appear. Transistioning from one page without the scroll bar 
to one with the scroll causes what I like to think of as the "Scroll Bar Shuffle" (_SBS_). scroll bar jump
Adding animations or loading content async can also cause the same problem.

It's just this small jump, often you do not notice it, but it can also be frustrating.
It can ofter cause anoyance in an othervise delightfull eperience.
