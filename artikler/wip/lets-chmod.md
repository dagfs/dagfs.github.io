# Let's change the mode

Ah, we are back here again. Something does not work. Some restriction is missing and the solutions is as usual to `chmod 777`it. Why does this work? What is `chmod`? and should you `chmod 777`? And how can you level up your `chmod`-ing?

## Why does this work? What is `chmod`?

change mode
It is the full form of the command. So basically you are changing the mode set as something to some other thing.

Read only permission to Read/Write permission, revoking read/write permission to just read only permission etc.
