# Manual of me

Based on Atlassians template

---

I'm strongly motiviated by helping others. While I'm experienced with many technologies, it's improving workflows and healping the team gain momentum that motivates me. Helping people get things done in general. So Helping out users with their work and removing frustration and bad experiences is important to me.

## Conditions I like to work in

- I like to work in quiet environments. I much prefer the office to a cafe. But I need som stimulation from the environment to work well.

- I usually wear my headphones. I loose my train of thoughts when I hear other people talking. Do not hesitate to poke me. I will let you know if I need a few min to wrap up my thoughts.

- I like having my own desk. I prefer not having to take work with me and I like to maximize by doing things right after work. I do not like to do repetitive tasks like setting up and taking down my work environment. I wanna get into work and use the momentum I hva from getting to work to go straight to work!

- I need social interactions and stimuli to keep motivation up. I prefer the possibility to have chit chat or discuss problems for a few minutes.

## When I like to work
- I much prefer working from 7-15. A few quiet hours in the morning, the spacing between meals works better and I get time for activities after work. 

- I do not mind being contacted at any time. I turn of my phones internet when I sleep or are busy. If it is important AND urgent. Call me. I will come back to you as soon as I feel like it. During work hours that usually means within a few min. Outside of work that might mean within a few min or the next day.

- I prefer having ling stretches of time available during the day to work on hard problems and get annoyed by regular meetings that breaks my day up.

## Best ways to communicate with me
Face to face / call > chat > email

## How I best receive feedback
Ask me if now is a good time to give me some feedback and then just let me know. AID or whatever is fine. I might ask a few questions to clearify. I prefer getting feedback face to face as it is easier to give details and examples.


## Things I need
I need some time by myself. I usually like to do a bit of reading and have a few minutes with my eyes closed with minimum stimuli.

## How I learn best
- I learn best by observing. Then doing. Or by reading and then trying it out. I need to convert things to internal models I can act upon. Audiotory or written instructions like recipies takes me a lot of effort to follow.

- I like to gather a lot of information about a topic and find similarities and create bolts that I can hook new information on.

## Things I struggle with
- I find it hard to do things I do not see the motivation for doing. I much prefer talking with people and be the one creating a task as to create good goals and first steps for the tasks than recieving vague task with no clear goal and multiple ways of interpriting them.

- I find it hard to take the time I need by myself. I get a lot of motivation to get things done by interacting with people. But I am truly an introvert.

## Things I love
- I love reading about how the human brain works and how to use it for good.

- I love creating good experiences for people. It can be seen in the components, presentations and jokes that I make.

- I love putting things into systems and simplifying life.

## Other things to know about me
- I use my intuition and feelings a lot in decition making. I have tried 

- I often think things are scary the first time i do them. I overthink and try to plan for everything so it ofthen requires a tramendus amount of energy. After having done them a few times most things requires little effort and I might even get a little sloppy. The things that does not become easy after a few tries I often avoid as they end up being things that does not give me energy.
