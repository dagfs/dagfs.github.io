This is mainly a output of my thoughts and an organizing of the stuff I read.

I want you to be ***critical*** when reading this document and looking at the sources referenced. The ideas presented here are the ones that I feel are important. They might not be important to you, they may even be wrong. All I know is that these are ideas that affect my and that I feel improve my understanding and ability to function.

## Self

Before looking at anything else I think it is most important to start with oneself.

### You have to take care of your self before you can take care of others

I will start out with referencing the podcast [Naval Ravikant on Reading, Happiness, Systems for Decision Making, Habits, Honesty and More](https://www.fs.blog/2017/02/naval-ravikant-reading-decision-making/). [Futher discussion on hacker news of Naval's talk](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13905251).
The key points from this talk is that **you have to care of your self before you can take take care of others**. This means physical and psychological health. This is not selfish even if it can feel so.


### You will probably experience one or more depressive episodes

So this is a big one. Life has many challenges. Relationships break, friends and family die, you can get fired, have to move houses, accidents happens. ***ref to article about stressful life events***.
Whatever the reasons or combination of reasons. **You will probably experience one or more depressive episodes during your life**. Tim Ferriss talks about depression and about how to get out of it in his talk [Why you should define your fears instead of your goals](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_ferriss_why_you_should_define_your_fears_instead_of_your_goals) and more about the same topic in [Design Matters with Debbie Millman: Tim Ferris](https://soundcloud.com/designmatters/design-matters-with-debbie-millman-tim-ferris).

Tim Ferriss talks about what is needed to get out of a depressive episode. This is of course something you should get some help with if you are experiencing this, but there are some factors that you can and should try to affect by your own, exercise, getting out of the house, having plans for multiple of the days of the week. There is a balance to what you need.

Some other factors you can change yourself is listed in [9 QUICK WAYS TO GET DEPRESSED](https://nicoleunice.com/9-quick-ways-to-get-depressed/).

There is a book named *At Last a Life* that in summary says "It is OK to feel like shit, Don't feel bad for it". This point is futhere argued in [How to practice emotional first aid | Guy Winch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2hc2FLOdhI) there Guy references emotional wounds in the same way as physical wounds. "You don't tell someone who has broken a leg to walk it of".
