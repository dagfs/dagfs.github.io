# Everything masters

## Master guidance

I enjoy supervising computer siences master projects and are interested in topics such as agile development, teams, process, learning.

I co-created a [Serious Privacy Game Workshop](https://dagfs.dev/sprig/) as my master thesis, combinding interests in IT, facilitating workshops and lecturing. 

### Currently co-supervising these master projects
- [Collaborative Educational Games for learning agile software development](./projects/agile-game/)
- [Burnout in IT education and industry - awareness, education and prevention](./projects/burnout/)
