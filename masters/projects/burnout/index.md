# Burnout in IT education and industry - awareness, education and prevention

Burnout is a complex problem that is hard to solve. Addressing this problem often requires cooperation between employees and employers, possibly involving external actors. There is a lot of research about burnout in general, and some within the context of IT and Open Source maintenance. But more can be done to turn what we know about burnout into tools that we can use in  IT education and industry. Models like Areas of Worklife Scale (AWS) among others seem interesting to turn into something that can be applied within IT education and industry.
This project will look into burnout from a knowledge work perspective aiming to raise awareness about burnout, help educate students, companies and employees and try to help prevent burnout through education.


The task will start with a literature review and interviews with IT students and/or professionals to understand better burnout in IT education and industry. This understanding will then be used to inform the design, prototype and evaluation of a tool for burnout awareness and education. The tool might be a game or another form of light-weight tool.
Students are welcome to discuss specific areas of interest, with respect to both topic and supporting tool.
