# Suggestion for a framework for burnout scenario

NB! This has few references and needs to be grounded more in the knowledge base.

It is based on the idea that a person can handle a certain amount of stress in their life. By stress, I mean arousal or stimulation, as the word "stress" has come to mean what should be thought of as "bad stress" or "too much stress".  Some of this stress. 

MBI is used to describe what dimensions a person is feeling the consequences of unmanaged stress. Normally this goes from exhaustion to cynicism to lack of efficacy/productivity. I believe some scenarios in IT end up progressing in other ways. I will expand later. It is also worth mentioning that I believe inverting the MBI factors to Energy, Engagement, and Efficacy/productivity is beneficial in working with this problem as those factors are something every company wants to strive for in their workers.
